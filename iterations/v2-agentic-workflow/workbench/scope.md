#### Architecture Diagram:
   ![Architecture Diagram](architecture_diagram.png)

#### Core Components:
1. **Pydantic AI Agent**: Responsible for handling user requests, processing data, and interacting with the Brave API.
2. **Brave API Integration**: Facilitates communication with the Brave browser to perform web searches.
3. **Data Processing Module**: Processes search results and presents them in a structured format.
4. **User Interface Module**: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the AI agent.
  
#### External Dependencies:
1. **Pydantic AI Framework**: For defining models and interacting with AI components.
2. **Brave Browser API**: External API for conducting web searches in the browser.
3. **User Interface Library**: Framework for building the user interface.
4. **Data Processing Libraries**: Libraries for aggregating and formatting search results.

#### Testing Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**: Verify the functionality of individual components such as data processing and API integration.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless interaction between different modules within the AI agent.
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Test the complete workflow from user input to search result presentation.
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Involve users to validate the search results and user interface interaction.

#### Relevant Documentation Pages for Creating the AI Agent:
1. https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/
2. https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/agent/
3. https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/exceptions/
4. https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/tools/
5. https://ai.pydantic.dev/examples/weather-agent/

By referring to the above documentation pages, we will be able to leverage Pydantic AI's models and tools to implement the AI agent that interacts with the Brave API for web searching effectively.
