**Scope Document for Pydantic AI Agent**

---

**Architecture Diagram:**
The architecture of the Pydantic AI agent will include modules for handling input processing, decision-making logic based on Pydantic models, and output generation. It will interact with external APIs and services to gather information and provide responses.

**Core Components:**
1. Input Processor: Responsible for parsing and understanding user inputs.
2. Decision Engine: Utilizes Pydantic models for processing and analyzing input data.
3. Output Generator: Creates coherent and meaningful responses based on the analysis.
4. External API Integration: Connects with external services for information retrieval.

**External Dependencies:**
1. Pydantic AI API for agent communication and model handling.
2. Relevant APIs for data retrieval and external services integration.
3. Necessary libraries for text processing and natural language understanding.

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Unit Testing: Ensure individual components function correctly.
2. Integration Testing: Verify interactions between components work seamlessly.
3. API Testing: Test API endpoints and data exchanges.
4. Functional Testing: Validate the agent's responses against expected outcomes.
5. User Acceptance Testing: Gather feedback from users to improve agent performance.
